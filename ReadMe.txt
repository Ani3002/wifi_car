Name of the Model: Landmine Finder

READ THE USER MANUAL 



USES:

Find Anti-tank Mines during war time and during movement of troops in vulnerable areas.  Anti-tank Mines usually require 100-500 kg of force to detonate. This remotely operated robot can safely go over these as it is very light.


Find Antipersonnel Mines during war time and anti terror operations. Antipersonnel Mines usually require 5-50 kg of force to detonate. This remotely operated robot can safely go over these as it is very light.

It can be used to clean up bombed areas after wartime and find unexploded explosives.

WORKING PRINCIPAL:


Metal Detector: It is an induction-based metal detector and has two coils. A transmitter coil that creates a magnetic field, and a receiver coil that senses changes when metal is close. When metal comes near, it makes eddy currents, creating a magnetic field that opposes the transmitter's field. The receiver coil detects this change and alerts us about the metal nearby.
