Here are the corrected sentences with improved grammar and clarity:

1) DO NOT power on the microcontroller while it is charging.

2) Use a charger that provides less than 1 amp of current to charge it through USB.

3) First, plug in the 12V DC power source, then turn on the switch for the ESP8266, and finally, turn on the remote by plugging in the red jumper cable at the back.

4) Wait for 10-15 seconds for the remote to pair with the LandMine Finder (car). When pairing is successful, the blue LED on the ESP32 will blink.

5) Do not push the joystick aggressively in any direction. Move it slowly and gently in each direction.

6) The Controller has 3 modes. The default mode upon turning it on is Mode 1. In Mode 1, the blue LED blinks once. The speed is low, and this is the recommended speed. By pressing the switch on the joystick, you can enter Mode 2, and the LED will blink twice. In Mode 2, the speed is high and not recommended for turning. It's suitable for traveling straight over longer distances in open areas. Turning is highly discouraged in Mode 2. Pressing the button once more will activate Mode 3, in which the car will not move. DO NOT PRESS THE JOYSTICK SWITCH WHEN THE LandMine Finder IS MOVING.

7) If you want to operate the LandMine Finder (Car) using a mobile phone, you need to turn off the controller. Restart the microcontroller by turning the black switch OFF and ON, then connect your phone's Wi-Fi to the Car. Turn off mobile data and hotspot, and open the controller app. To use it with your controller again, disconnect the phone, restart the ESP8266, and turn on the ESP32 controller.
